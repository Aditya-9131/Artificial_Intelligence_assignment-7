Given_question:
->Solve the 8-puzzle problem using a blind search and heuristic search algorithm and, compare
their performance using the following statistics: (15+15=30)
(a) the total number of nodes expanded
(b) the total number of nodes generated
(c) the maximum length of the queue structure
(d) the length of the solution path (number of moves)
The uninformed search algorithm that you will implement will be Iterative Deepening
Search. The informed search algorithm that you will implement will be A* using
the misplaced tile heuristic.
Consider the following initial state and final state for the problem
Initial state
8 2
3 4 7
5 1 6
Final state
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8
